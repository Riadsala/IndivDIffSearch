\subsection{Participants}
How many? Will all testing be done at the University of Aberdeen? How do we justify our sample size (a question commonly asked by journals now!)?

\subsection{Materials and Procedures}

The study consists of three different paradigms from the visual search literature in which strong individual differences were found \citep{nowakowsak2017, irons-leber2016, kristjansson2014}.

\subsubsection{A: Split-half array search}

\subsubsection{B: Attentional Control}

\subsubsection{C: Conjunction Foraging}
